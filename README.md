### What I learned

While working on this project, I got an idea of how displays work and why they play an important role when positioning elements in css. 

### Continued development

I want to continue working and experimenting with displays as I don't feel as I am too comfortable with them. On top of that, I have only scratched the surface with positioning elements and want to figure out how to do it differently or more easily. 

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://html-css-js.com/css/generator/box-shadow/) - When trying to find the perfect box shadow, this website helped me a ton. I'd recommend it to anyone who has trouble finding the perfect box shadow for their project.
